      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman. He is known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has been considered the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$424.7 billion. \n",
      "Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada. He received bachelor's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 before moving to California, United States, to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. He was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021.\n",
      "Musk's political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. In early 2025, he served as senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and as the de facto head of DOGE. His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.\n",

      "Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.\n",

      "It was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute in Germany, where making such gestures is illegal. The Anti-Defamation League said it was not a Nazi salute, but other Jewish organizations disagreed and condemned the salute. American public opinion was divided on partisan lines as to whether it was a fascist salute. Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them as \"dirty tricks\" and a \"tired\" attack. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated it as a Nazi salute. Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be ba\u001b[0m\n",

       "'Alright, I\\'m still a little unsure which \"match\" you\\'re referring to! Since I\\'m designed to be helpful, I\\'ll try one more time to narrow it down:\\n\\n**Possibility 1: You mean \"math\" and are still asking about the multiplication problem.**\\n\\nIn that case, the location is still within my internal processing units. Think of it like this: the calculation happened \"inside my head,\" not in a specific city or building. There\\'s no physical location for it.\\n\\n**Possibility 2: You mean a sporting \"match.\"**\\n\\nIf this is the case, I *really* need more information to help you. I don\\'t have access to a general sports database. Think about the details that would help someone else understand which match you\\'re talking about. For example:\\n\\n*   **Sport:** Was it a baseball game? A soccer match? A tennis tournament?\\n*   **Teams/Players:** Who was playing? Knowing the teams or players involved would be a huge clue.\\n*   **Date/Timeframe:** When did the match happen? Even a general timeframe (e.g., \"last summer,\" \"this past weekend\") would be helpful.\\n\\nWithout more information, I\\'m just guessing, and I\\'d rather not give you an incorrect answer! Please tell me more about the match you\\'re interested in.'"
